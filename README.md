# SMA-Modbus-energy-management-system
EMS in Home Assisant and node red

I made en Energy Management system in node red that runs as an adon in Home Assistant.

Goal: The goal of this EMS is to make my classic SMA inverter a bit smarter, so I can take advantage of some situations and but trying to avoid the negative situations using hourly dynamic elictricity prices.
